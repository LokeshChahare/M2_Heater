### The winter weather kicks into high gear, car owners might want to do a little extra work to make sure their cars are comfortable. Many people believe that a car has to come with heated seats as it gives us comfort during the winter season.
### o Heated seats simply need to warm up the seat itself so instant heating takes place.
### o The interior of the car is still fairly cold because only seats are heating.
