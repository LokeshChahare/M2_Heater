## INTRODUCTION

###  The winter weather kicks into high gear, car owners might want to do a little extra work to make sure their cars are comfortable. Many people believe that a car has to come with heated seats as it gives us comfort during the winter season.

### It can take a while for a heater to warm up an entire vehicle. Heated seats simply need to warm up the seat itself, so you'll begin to feel warm almost immediately even if the interior of the car is still fairly cold. Heated seats transfer heat directly to you rather than warming up the interior of the car. Because of this, heated seats can actually conserve energy you might not need the heater on at all if you've heated your seats. Heated seats will also dissipate some heat into the air, warming the vehicle as a whole. 

## RESEARCH
### Why it is importatnt to have heated seats?
### Heated seats are usually more effective in areas with a mild cold rather than an extremely severe cold; otherwise they may have to be used in tandem with the car heater.



### How sensors keep you safe?
### The longer the seat cushion stays on, the hotter it gets. If it were to stay on for too long, it would get hot enough to become uncomfortable or even dangerous to sit in. It could even start a fire in the cushion. To prevent this, most car seat heaters have a thermostat. The thermostat measures the temperature in the cushion. When it reaches a certain temperature, the thermostat sends a signal, automatically turning off the relay until the seat cools down a bit.
