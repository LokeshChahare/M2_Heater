## ABSTRACT
### Seat Heater is to turn on the Heater and sense the temperature in the environment of the passenger when he is seated on the seat and the Heater switch is turned on and display the temperate on serial monitor.The Seat Heater system is coded in embedded c and the working is demonstrated using simuation in a software called SimulIDE.

## FEATURES
### o The passenger's seating status and the Heater switch is shown using 2 switches.To indicate the success of this condition and to show Heater is ON, LED glows. The sensing of the temperature is depicted with the help of a potentiometer.
### o The analaog value from pot is converted to digital depending on the given limits with respect to voltage in terms of temperature.
### oThe output from this ADC in terms of PWM is shown in the oscilloscope.
